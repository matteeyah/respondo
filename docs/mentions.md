The mention view is composed of three sections - the header, the main area and
the footer.

The header shows you which social media account is the source of the
mention, the tags on a mention and a dropdown for secondary actions.

The main part houses information about the mention author, the mention content,
the timestamp on a mention and actions for showing the internal notes, assigning
and updating the mention status.

The footer houses the mention reply form.
