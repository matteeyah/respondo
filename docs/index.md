> AI powered ticketing system for social media posts

## Overview

[Respondo](https://respondohub.com/) is a tool that uses a ticketing approach
(similar to Zendesk) for responding to social media posts. It's supercharged by
AI to make responding effortless.

## Sign In

Authentication is handled exclusively with Google or Microsoft AD. This allows
users to easily sign in with just one click using one of their social accounts.

## Dashboard

<https://app.respondohub.com/dashboard>

After you log in you will be presented with a dashboard for your organization.
This dashboard shows basic information:

- Number of open tickets
- Number of solved tickets
- Number of unassigned tickets
- Number of new tickets
- Feed of new tickets

## Basic usage

Every time somebody mentions the organizations's handle on any social network
that is currently integrated with that organization's Respondo, a new ticket is
created under `Open tickets`.
