> Ticketing system for social media posts

## Overview

[Respondo](https://respondohub.com/) uses a ticket approach (similar to Zendesk)
to social media. You can filter tickets by status and search them by author
name or content.

## Sign In

Authentication is handled exclusively with Google or Microsoft AD. This allows
users to easily sign in with just one click using one of their social accounts.

## Dashboard

<https://app.respondohub.com/dashboard>

After you log in you will be presented with a dashboard for your brand. This
dashboard shows basic information:

- Number of open tickets
- Number of solved tickets
- Number of unassigned tickets
- Number of new tickets
- Feed of new tickets

## Basic usage

Every time somebody mentions the brand's handle on any social network that is
currently integrated with that brand's Respondo, a new ticket is created under
`Open tickets`.
