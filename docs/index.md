# Respondo docs

> Ticketing system for social media posts

## Overview

[Respondo](https://respondohub.com/) uses a ticket approach (similar to Zendesk)
to social media. You can filter tickets by status and search them by author
name or content.

## Sign In

Authentication is handled exclusively with OAuth. This allows users to easily
sign in with just one click using one of their social accounts.

## Basic navigation

After navigating to the [Tickets page](https://docs.respondohub.com/tickets) of
the authenticated brand, you can choose between `Open tickets` and
`Solved tickets`.

Every time somebody mentions the brand's handle on any social network that is
currently integrated with that brand's Respondo, a new ticket is created under
`Open tickets`.
