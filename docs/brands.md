# Managing brands

When you first sign in, you can click `Authorize` to connect your brand
Twitter account.

When signed in, you can load new tickets associated with your Brand by pressing
the `Load Tickets` button.

## Brand accounts

Respondo can automatically integrate your Twitter and Disqus accounts. To do so,
navigate to the `Brand Settings` page and you'll be able to authorize or
deauthorize these accounts.

## Brand members

You can add or remove users from your brand. All associated users are able to
respond to the related Brand tickets using the authorized Brand account on that
social network.

## Brand domain

You can define a brand domain. All users who authenticate with an email address
on this domain are automatically added to the associated brand after
registration.
