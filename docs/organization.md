When you first sign in, you can click `Authorize` to connect your organization
Twitter account.

When signed in, you can load new tickets associated with your Organization by
pressing the `Reload` button in the tickets page.

## Organization accounts

Respondo can automatically integrate your Twitter and Disqus accounts. To do so,
navigate to the `Organization Settings` page and you'll be able to authorize or
deauthorize these accounts.

## Organization members

You can add or remove users from your organization. All associated users are
able to respond to the related Organization tickets using the authorized
Organization account on that social network.

## Organization domain

You can define a organization domain. All users who authenticate with an email
address on this domain are automatically added to the associated organization
after registration.
