# Managing users

## User accounts

Respondo can automatically integrate your Twitter, Disqus, and Google Accounts.
To do so, navigate to the `User Settings` page and you'll be able to authorize
or deauthorize these accounts.

## Personal Access Tokens

You can add or remove personal access tokens in the `User Settings` page. Every
token needs a name. This name is later used for identifying tokens for deletion.
The token value is shown only once after creation.
