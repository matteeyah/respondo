# How to contribute

## Opening issues

Please open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/Respondo/respondo/issues/new).

* Search through existing issues to make sure you're not creating a duplicate
* Label the issue with appropriate labels
* Include a minimal functional example of the change in behavior you're proposing

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/Respondo/respondo/pull/new/master)
(read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

* Include a clear list of what you've done
* Include unit, integration and functional tests for any new functionality you
  introduce where applicable
* Follow our coding conventions
* Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit)

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine
for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
>
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for:

* Stability
* Convention over Configuration
* Development Velocity

Thanks,
Matija
